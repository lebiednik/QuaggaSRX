  * Added missing capability exchange for extended BGP messages (>4096) bytes
    as specified in draft-ietf-idr-extended-messages
  * Added capability to specify K for generating signatures using ECDSA
  * Added capability to specify if the BGP Path Attribute should use a one byte
    length field or if the length field should be 2 byte (3xtended length). 
    For this the parameter only_extended_length (default: true) is added to the
    configuration file.

    attributes length field is only one byte of size.
